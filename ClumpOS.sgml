the OpenMosix-based release is on hold, for internal reasons, until 
OpenMosix for 2.4.17 (or greater) kernel become available... and since i 
don't have a release schedule for OpenMosix itself, I'm afraid that i 
can't tell you exactly when that'll be... ;)

clump/os is a CD-based Linux /MOSIX mini-distribution designed to allow
users to quickly, or temporarily, add nodes to a MOSIX cluster; As I write 
this in march 2002 the version (release 5.x) is a 5.3M ISO download.

This chapter has been contributed by Jean-David Marrow who is the main 
author of Clump/OS.

<SECT1><TITLE>How does it work </TITLE> 

<para> At boot-time, clump/os will
auto-probe for network cards, and, if any are detected, try to configure
them via DHCP. If successful, it will create a mosix.map file based on the
assumption that all nodes are on local CLASS C networks, and configure
MOSIX using this information. 
</para>
<para>
clump/os Release 4 best supports machines with a single connected network
adapter. The MOSIX map created in such cases will consist of a single
entry for the CLASS-C network detected, with the node number assigned
reflecting the IP address received from DHCP. (On the 192.168.1 network,
node #1 will be 192.168.1.1, etc.) If you use multiple network adapters
Expert mode is recommended as the assignment of node numbers is sensitive
to the order in which network adapters are detected. (Future releases will
support complex topologies and feature more intelligent MOSIX map
creation.)
</para>
<para>

clump/os will then display a simple SVGA
monitor (clumpview) indicating whether the node is configured, and, if it
is, showing the load on all active nodes on the network. When you've
finished using this node, simply press [ESC] to exit the interface and
shutdown. </para>

<PARA> Alternatively, or if auto-configuration doesn't work for you, then
you can use clump/os in Expert mode. Please note that clump/os is not a
complete distribution or a rescue disk; the functionality present is the
bare minimum required for a working MOSIX server node.
</PARA>

<PARA> It works for us, but may not work for you; if you experience
difficulties, please email us with as much information about your system
as possible -- after you have investigated the problem.  (See Problems?
and Expert mode. You might also consider subscribing to the clump/os
mailing list.)  </PARA>

   As the purpose of clump/os is to add nodes to a cluster, it is assumed 
that you already have a running MOSIX
   cluster -- or perhaps only a single MOSIX node -- from which you will 
be initiating jobs. All machines in the cluster
   must conform to the following requirements:

you should have at least 64M of RAM (and likely more) to accommodate
the approx. 16M ramdisk, space needed for Linux itself, and space
for your work. This approach was chosen so that the same CD-ROM
can be used to configure multiple systems.)

   Please also note that clump/os may not work on a laptop, definitely 
doesn't support PCMCIA cards, and will
   probably not configure MOSIX properly if your machine contains multiple 
connected Ethernet adapters; see Note 1.
   This is a temporary limitation of the configuration scripts, and the 
Release 3/4 kernels which are compiled without
   CONFIG_MOSIX_TOPOLOGY

   You can download the latest clump/os ISO under the terms of the 
GPL, without warranty of any kind, from the clump os website. 
Afterwards you have to burn the image to CD-ROM, insert the CD into 
your drive, and reboot.
   (More detailed instructions are in the works, but all the 
information you need is somewhere on this page -- please read
   the notes in the margin!)

   Boot into Expert mode, and send us mail describing your video hardware

   versions. (You won't be able to use clumpview for now.) If at all 
possible, please send us a working libsvga

   The network adapter isn't detected/autoconfigured (or no DHCP)
</EMPHASIS>
</PARA>
<PARA>
   If you see a message (in clumpview) stating that no Ethernet devices 
were configured, or that this node isn't
   configured yet, then either your Ethernet card was not detected or the 
system was not able to configure the card via
   DHCP. 
</PARA><PARA>
   If you don't have a DHCP server configured and running on your local 
network, clump/os will never autoconfigure;
   if you have multiple connected network adapters, then clump/os may not 
configure MOSIX properly. If
   auto-probing for your network adapter doesn't work, or if you aren't 
using DHCP, then you'll have to configure your
   card manually in Expert mode -- using insmod, ifconfig, and route -- 
and then configure MOSIX via setpe. 
</PARA><PARA>

   If you do need to manually configure your network adapter, please 
advise us. We'd like to solve this problem, if
   possible, or at least document which network cards auto-probe correctly.

</EMPHASIS>
</PARA>
<PARA>

   This rare problem can be caused by conflicts resulting from differently 
configured kernels -- even if you are using the
   correct MOSIX and Linux kernel versions. If clump/os correctly detects 
all your nodes, but migrating processes
   generate errors, then please compare your master node's kernel 
configuration file with the R4.x kernel .config.

   Migrating processes generate errors ("Process migration failed: 
incompatible topology")

</PARA>
<PARA>

   You are likely using master nodes with CONFIG_MOSIX_TOPOLOGY defined, 
which is not supported by clump/os
   at this time. See Requirements, and compare your kernel configuration 
as per the previous FAQ; you will need to
   recompile your master node kernel(s).

If you don't find your issue here, please consider posting to the
clump/os mailing list. (Please note that only subscribers are
permitted to post; click on the link for instructions.) You should also
make certain that you are using the latest versions of MOSIX and
clump/os, and that the versions -- clump/os R4.x and
MOSIX 1.5.2 at the time of this writing -- are in sync.

 <SECT1><TITLE>Expert Mode
</TITLE>

<PARA> If you hold down shift during the boot process, you have the option
of booting into Expert mode; this will cause clump/os to boot to a shell
rather than to the graphical interface.  From this shell you can attempt
to insert the appropriate module for your network adapter (if autoprobing
failed), and/or configure your network and MOSIX manually. Type "halt" to
shut down the system. (Note that since the system resides in RAM you can't
hurt yourself too badly by rebooting the hard way if you have to -- unless
you have manually mounted any partitions rw, that is, and we don't
recommend doing so at this point.)  </PARA>


<PARA>
   If you want to run clumpview, execute: 
<PROGRAMLISTING>
     open -s -w -- clumpview --drone --svgalib
</PROGRAMLISTING>


This will force the node into 'drone' mode (local processes will not 
migrate), and will force clumpview to use SVGALIB;
the open command will ensure that a separate vt is used. 
</PARA><PARA>
Please be advised that the environment provided was initially 
intentionally minimalistic; if you require additional files, or wish to
copy files from the system to another machine, your only option is
nc (netcat -- a great little utility, btw), or mfs if MOSIX is
configured.  From version R5.4 on size is no longer a primary 
consideration.

</PARA><PARA> Expert mode (and clump/os for that matter) is 'single-user';
this is one of the reasons that utilities such as ssh are not included.
These and other similar decisions were made in order to keep clump/os
relatively small, and do not affect cluster operation. </PARA> <PARA>


From version R5.4,  if you experience problems in Expert Mode, you 
can boot into Safe Mode; in Safe Mode no
   attempt is made at autoconfiguration.
