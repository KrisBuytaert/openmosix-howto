<para>
One of the more frequent used application in this field is Blast, 

<ulink url="http://stl.bioinformatics.med.umich.edu/software/OM_BLAST_patch/openmosixpatch.html">
<citetitle>Blast has a patch available that makes it work smoother 
</citetitle></ulink>

with openMosix, but that's not the only alternative.
</para>
<para>First of all there are some known problems with this patch,  and other 
versions of blast , blast tends to segfault sometimes, this mostly happens 
with the preformatted databases you download from the internet. 
If you run formatdb on a raw database these errors tend to go away.

<para>Next to the openMosix blast patch a lot of people run <ulink 
url="http://mpiblast.lanl.gov/"><citetitle>MPIBlast</citetitle></ulink>
Given the fact that openMosix tends to speed up MPI, adding openMosix to this 
config might even give you more power for your money, however we will have to 
do some extra research to be able to confirm this.
