What is PlumpOS?

  </para></question>  <!-- QUESTION STOPS HERE -->

  <answer><para>      <!-- ANSWER STARTS HERE -->

PlumpOS is a mini linux distribution aimed at an easy way to add nodes
to an openMosix cluster without a lot of work or even thought. The
original idea came from (and current development is inspired by)
ClumpOS, the now deceased project by Jean-David Marrow with a very
similar goal for MOSIX clusters.

Why would I use PlumpOS?

  </para></question>  <!-- QUESTION STOPS HERE -->

  <answer><para>      <!-- ANSWER STARTS HERE -->

The first reason to use PlumpOS is to try out openMosix clusters in a
simple and convenient fashion. The second reason is to add nodes to an
existing cluster without a lot of work. PlumpOS is in no way a
replacement for enterprise clusters nor does it strive to be some kind
of super duper cluster project; it merely presents a quick and easy
way to turn your average 586+ PC into another node for your cluster.

How does it work?

  </para></question>  <!-- QUESTION STOPS HERE -->

  <answer><para>      <!-- ANSWER STARTS HERE -->

From a developer's standpoint it's somewhat difficult but to the
common user it's quite simple: simply burn an ISO with all the
required files on it, pop it into a computer's CDROM drive, boot up
the PC (making sure there's a working network card and cable
installed) and there you have one more computer to distribute
load/forked processes to. Because it's a child/slave node, you have to
already have an openMosix box up and running to run tasks for PlumpOS
computers to process. Without a master node, PlumpOS is pretty
useless. That computer or some other network device must already be
serving DHCP addresses or you'll find yourself configuring all your
PlumpOS nodes by hand (which won't make for a happy network
administrator - but then again that's why we have junior admins ^_^).

Also, make sure you have the openMosix autodiscovery daemon (aka
omdiscd) running on your master node. The autodiscovery daemon can be
found into openMosix's userspace-tools package.

The penguins are gonna eat the poor halibut in the logo!

  </para></question>  <!-- QUESTION STOPS HERE -->

  <answer><para>      <!-- ANSWER STARTS HERE -->

Yes, but not to worry: no halibuts were harmed in the making of the
logo. The halibut was found deceased on an ice drift after having
suffered a heart attack. Also, any resemblance the halibut may have to
another operating system's mascot of choice is purely coincidental.
